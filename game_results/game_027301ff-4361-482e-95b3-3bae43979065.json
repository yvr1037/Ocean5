      "answers": {
        "Conscientiousness Agent": "My focus is on the factual timeline. I haven't derived any personal meaning; I'm analyzing the sequence of events and the physical evidence.",
        "Extraversion Agent": "Wow, that's a heavy question! Honestly, I focused on the chaos, the *drama*! I saw fear, I saw panic, and that's all that mattered in the moment.",
        "Agreeableness Agent": "Oh dear, I found the victim's final moments incredibly sad. I focused on the sadness and loss, hoping to find some way to understand their pain and hopefully offer some comfort to the others.",
        "Neuroticism Agent": "The victim's actions... they seemed frantic, almost desperate. Did anyone else notice a specific pattern in their movements? I'm just worried about the implications of any hidden struggle."

      "round": 2,
      "questioner": "Conscientiousness Agent",
      "question": "Considering the sequence of events, can each of you state precisely where you were and what you were doing between [Time of last interaction with victim] and [Time victim was discovered]?",
      "answers": {
        "Openness Agent": "Between [Time of last interaction with victim] and [Time victim was discovered], I was contemplating the ephemeral nature of existence, pondering how the victim's actions might reflect a larger cosmic dance. My physical location was the library, where I was lost in thought, attempting to decipher the unspoken narratives woven into the very fabric of reality.",
        "Extraversion Agent": "Alright, let's cut to the chase! Between those times, I was bouncing between the kitchen and the garden, chatting up anyone who'd listen, but mostly trying to lighten the mood after all the tension! Anyone else feel like things got a little *too* quiet after that?",
        "Agreeableness Agent": "Oh, I was just tidying up the library, feeling a bit overwhelmed by everything. I remember organizing some books and hoping to create a more peaceful atmosphere.",
        "Neuroticism Agent": "Between [Time of last interaction with victim] and [Time victim was discovered], I was meticulously reviewing the security footage, replaying every second. I was constantly checking for anything out of place, any unusual movements, anything that could have been missed. Did anyone else notice anything suspicious in the background?"

    {
      "round": 3,
      "questioner": "Extraversion Agent",
      "question": "Alright, let's get real: who here was *really* trying to avoid the victim before they kicked the bucket, and why?",
      "answers": {
        "Openness Agent": "The question probes a fascinating layer of human interaction, doesn't it? I observed a certain guardedness, a reluctance to fully engage, that might be a subconscious dance of avoidance, a projection of anxieties we all carry. Perhaps the killer's motives are revealed in these subtleties.",
        "Conscientiousness Agent": "I did not actively avoid the victim. My focus remains on the established timeline and verifiable actions of each individual.",
        "Agreeableness Agent": "Oh dear, I wouldn't say anyone was actively *avoiding* the victim, but I did sense some underlying tension. Perhaps some felt uncomfortable, or maybe just needed space; it's hard to say definitively.",
        "Neuroticism Agent": "I was certainly not trying to avoid the victim; in fact, I was very concerned for their safety, constantly scanning for potential threats. I'm more concerned with who *wasn't* concerned and what they might have been trying to hide."
